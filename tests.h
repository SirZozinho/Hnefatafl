 * @brief Declarations of test functions for testing the fonctions implemented in 'fonctions.cpp'.
 *
 * This file contains the declarations of test functions used to verify and validate
 * the functionality of the functions implemented in 'fonctions.cpp.'
 * These test functions are designed to thoroughly test various aspects of the code
 * in 'fonctions.cpp' to ensure that it performs as expected.
 * They cover a range of scenarios and edge cases, helping to identify and resolve
 * any potential issues or bugs in the codebase.
 * The tests are conducted on different board sizes and configurations,
 * providing comprehensive coverage to guarantee the reliability and correctness
 * of the functions in 'fonctions.cpp.'
 * Overall, 'test.cpp' plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality and robustness by confirming
 * that the functions it tests meet their intended specifications."
